# Healthier Richmond's Youth Leadership
Youth Leadership for a Healthier Richmond’s mission is to create a healthy and happy community for all. The program is for diverse youth that promotes leadership and community empowerment to make positive change in Richmond. This year, we are working on shaping marijuana policy at the state and local level. The project will be run out of Richmond High School’s Health Academy as an after school health equity club. Youth interns will develop skills to become effective agents of change for their community, advocating for more resources in Richmond for youth development and prevention programs, analyzing the issues and seeing how tax dollars from marijuana dispensaries can help support this opportunity, as well as bringing youth voices to helping shape the likely marijuana legalization ballot measure in California in November 2016.

[Healthy Richmond](https://www.healthyrichmond.net) is one of 14 community efforts in the state selected by The California Endowment to improve health systems and address physical, social, and economic issues in order to support healthy behaviors. The 10-year project encourages Richmond residents to accomplish 10 outcomes that address health care, prevention, violence, youth development, the community environment, health gaps for men and boys of color and more. Richmond was selected to participate for its potential to develop into a community that can be modeled, replicated, and inspire policy changes to create a healthy environment for all Californians.
