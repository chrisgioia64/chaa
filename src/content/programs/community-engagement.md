The Asian and Pacific Islander Connections program (API Connections) is one of five prevention and early intervention (PEI) projects funded by the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) (Prop 63) through Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services for Prevention & Early Intervention programming, API Connections is co-led by CHAA and ACMHS.

API Connections aims to promote wellness in API communities living in Alameda County and help overcome stigma through culturally competent outreach.
